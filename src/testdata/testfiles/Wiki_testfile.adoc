= Sybil Test Utility

== Description

image::https://i.nostr.build/Jo7qwDu7rgYkMIWJ.png"[Sybil gazing into a crystal ball, 200]

This is a simple PHP CLI program that takes an edited/pre-formatted Asciidoc document, splits it into the specific sections defined, generates a https://next-alexandria.gitcitadel.eu/publication?d=gitcitadel-project-documentation-curated-publications-specification-7-by-stella-v-1[curated publication] from that file (kind ```30040```, with an included, ordered list of kind ```30041``` sections/articles), and writes it to the relays selected.

I've since begun to expand it, to keep up with the development of our web GUI, and to provide myself with some functions I often require in testing. It now also covers longform articles (kind ```30023```) and wiki pages (kind ```30818```), as well as offering event delete, fetch, and broadcast utilities.

I've changed the project name to _Sybil_, from _ebook Upload Utility_ to reflect the more universal application it now covers. It's slowly becoming an interesting app, in its own right.
