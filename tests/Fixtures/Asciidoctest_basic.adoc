=== Basic Math Expressions

Here's a simple equation: asciimath:[sqrt(4) = 2]

And an inline expression with asciimath notation: asciimath:[x^2 + y^2 = z^2]

=== Block Math Expressions

Here's a block equation:

[asciimath]
++++
sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2
++++

And another one with explicit asciimath notation:

[asciimath]
++++
f(x) = int_{-infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt
++++

=== Complex Expressions

Here's a more complex expression:

[asciimath]
++++
lim_(N->oo) sum_(i=1)^N i = (N(N+1))/2
++++

And a matrix:

[asciimath]
++++
[[a,b],[c,d]]
++++

=== LaTeX Math

We can also use LaTeX math notation:

[latexmath]
++++
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
++++
